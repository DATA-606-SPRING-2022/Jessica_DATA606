Spring 2022 - Data Science Capstone Project

Motivation:

The game industry is intensly competative, with many games coming out every year from both large game producers and small indie games. In such a competative market, anything that can provide an edge on the competition is desireable. It is therefore important to understand the characteristics of a successful game, both in terms of content (genre, descriptions, etc.) and in terms of marketing (price points, key terms and phrases, artwork etc.). 


## Investigating Characteristics of Successful Video Games on Steam

Data set: Steam API - Dataset of 1000 games and associated data fields, potential to include artwork as a feature if data is available.

Potential methods of accessing the API - SteamSpy API; steam web API - https://steamapi.xpaw.me/


Possible Project Elements:
- Clustering Of Description Data
- Analysis of Reviews
- Artwork Analysis using CNNs - is there a relationship between the artwork and ratings? Video games are extremely visual, it would make sense if there was.
- Training a Predictive Model using Metacritic Ratings as a Target Variable
